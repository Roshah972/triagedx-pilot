TRIAGEDX – ER Walk-In Intake & Triage Accelerator

Pilot v12

⸻

0. One-Line Summary

TRIAGEDX is a web-based intake + triage accelerator for Emergency Department (ED) walk-in patients, shifting data entry from staff to patients, generating a provisional Early Warning Score (EWS) and risk flags, and pushing verified structured intake data into EPIC (via FHIR) to remove registration bottlenecks and reduce dangerous delays—without replacing formal nurse triage.

⸻

1. Strategic Context

1.1 Problem Space (Real ER Reality)

US ER intake is dominated by:
	•	Manual registration at a front desk
	•	Repeated questions about demographics, insurance, and chief complaint
	•	No early risk signal before nurse triage

Key pain points (from multiple nurse interviews):
	1.	Registration bottlenecks and lines at the front desk
	2.	Dangerous delays before clinical triage; high-risk patients may sit in the lobby with no visibility
	3.	Double documentation: nurses/registrars re-typing info into EPIC
	4.	No automated early warning score at arrival
	5.	Fragmented workflow across multiple systems/forms
	6.	Overloaded front desk staff dragging nurses into non-clinical tasks
	7.	Poor patient communication and no expectation management
	8.	Language barriers increasing registration time
	9.	Repeat patients answering the same questions every visit
	10.	Staff burnout due to time-wasting, low-value tasks
	11.	No real-time overview of waiting room risk
	12.	Inconsistent symptom gathering between nurses
	13.	Time lost on low-value data entry (address, DOB, IDs)

1.2 Non-Negotiable Constraints
	•	Walk-in environment: no scheduled visits, no mandatory pre-arrival registration.
	•	System must collapse steps for staff, not add new ones.
	•	Must support edge cases:
	•	No phone / can’t use tech
	•	No ID / no insurance
	•	Intoxicated/altered patients
	•	Trauma / direct-to-room
	•	Proxies (family/visitor fills info)
	•	Must be designed to integrate with EPIC via FHIR, not replace it.
	•	Clinical boundary: TRIAGEDX does not perform or replace formal nurse triage and is not a real-time monitoring device. Nurses remain fully responsible for official triage and documentation in the EHR.

2. Core Concept & Modules

2.1 High-Level Architecture

TRIAGEDX is conceptually split into:
	1.	P-Portal (Patient Portal) – Lobby self-check-in via:
	•	Mobile (QR code)
	•	Kiosk/tablet
	•	Staff-assisted mode
	2.	S-Dashboard (Staff Dashboard) – Real-time triage & registration command center for:
	•	Nurses
	•	Registrars
	•	Charge nurses / leadership
	3.	Triage Engine – Age-aware, sex-aware chief complaint evaluation that:
	•	Uses rule-based severity assignment (RED/ORANGE/YELLOW/GREEN)
	•	Considers age brackets (INFANT, CHILD, ADOLESCENT, ADULT, GERIATRIC)
	•	Considers biological sex (pregnancy, atypical presentations)
	•	Outputs a provisional severity + EWS level (CRITICAL/HIGH/MODERATE/LOW) and human-readable rationale
	4.	FHIR/EPIC Integration Layer
	•	Maps internal data models to FHIR resources
	•	Pushes verified intake + encounter metadata into EPIC
	5.	Analytics & Admin Panel
	•	Ops metrics (time-to-triage, LWBS risk, risk mix)
	•	Configuration (question sets, thresholds, languages)

3. User Roles & Permissions

3.1 Patient

Abilities:
	•	Start self-check-in via QR or kiosk
	•	Enter demographics, contact, insurance, chief complaint, and symptoms

	•	Mark data as verified
	•	Push verified demographic/insurance data into EPIC via FHIR
	•	Mark patients as “Verified / ready for triage”

3.3 Triage Nurse

Abilities:
	•	See real-time risk-sorted queue of waiting patients
	•	View patient card (symptoms, provisional EWS, rule-based flags, wait time)
	•	Call patient from dashboard
	•	Enter vitals and mark triage complete in TRIAGEDX (for verified EWS support), but:
	•	Official triage assessment (ESI, vitals, notes) is still documented in EPIC
	•	Update patient status (Called to triage, Roomed, LWBS, etc.)
	•	Mark visit as “Triage Complete” in TRIAGEDX, which:
	•	Locks the pre-triage snapshot
	•	Clears the waiting-room queue entry

4. Patient Journey / Flows

4.1 Default Flow – Walk-In Self-Check-In
	1.	Patient arrives in ER lobby.
	2.	Sees large QR code and/or kiosk labeled “Check In Here”.
	3.	Opens P-Portal:
	•	On mobile via QR
	•	On kiosk tablet
	4.	Completes intake steps:
	•	Demographics
	•	Contact info
	•	Insurance & ID scan (if possible)
	•	Chief complaint (free text + category)
	•	Symptom questions (dynamic, complaint-specific)
	•	Relevant risk factors
	5.	Submits form.
	6.	Backend creates/updates PatientProfile + Visit + IntakeForm.
	7.	Triage engine evaluates chief complaint (age/sex aware) and assigns provisional severity (RED/ORANGE/YELLOW/GREEN).
	8.	Severity is converted to provisional EWS level (CRITICAL/HIGH/MODERATE/LOW).
	9.	S-Dashboard updates in real time with a new patient card showing:
	•	Name / alias
	•	Age / sex
	•	Time of arrival + wait duration
	•	Chief complaint
	•	Key symptom highlights
	•	Provisional EWS (color-coded)
	•	Verification status (Not Verified / Verified)
	10.	Registrar opens Quick-Verify:
	•	Confirms or edits name + DOB
	•	Glances at ID/insurance images
	•	Marks demographics/insurance as Verified
	•	Clicks “Verify & Push to EPIC” to send FHIR Patient + Coverage + Encounter shell to EPIC.
	11.	Triage nurse uses S-Dashboard to:
	•	See risk-sorted queue
	•	Review complaint & flags
	•	Call patient to triage
	12.	Nurse performs official triage:
	•	Uses hospital equipment for vitals
	•	Follows ED triage protocol
	•	Documents triage and vitals in EPIC as usual
	13.	Optionally, nurse enters vitals into TRIAGEDX:
	•	Records vitals → verified EWS recalculated
	•	Marks visit as “Triage Complete”:
	•	Locks TRIAGEDX pre-triage snapshot + verified EWS
	•	Updates status in queue (Roomed / Waiting for MD / etc.)

Important: TRIAGEDX never claims its EWS replaces clinical judgment or official triage in EPIC. It provides a pre-triage snapshot + advisory score only.

4.2 Staff-Assisted Quick-Check Flow (Edge Case)

Used when patient can’t or won’t use P-Portal:
	1.	Registrar or nurse opens staff-assisted intake form (same backend schema).
	2.	Captures minimal subset:
	•	Name (or alias if unknown)
	•	Approximate age / DOB if possible
	•	Chief complaint
	•	2–3 high-risk screening questions
	3.	Submits → triggers triage engine and creates a Visit.
	4.	Patient appears on S-Dashboard with provisional EWS and minimal data.
	5.	Full demographics/insurance are gathered and verified later when feasible.

4.3 Trauma / Direct-to-Room Bypass

For critical arrivals where triage happens immediately:
	1.	Staff marks “Direct-to-room” in TRIAGEDX with minimal data:
	•	Alias / placeholder name
	•	Age range (if needed)
	•	Chief complaint (e.g., “Trauma”, “Code Stroke”, etc.)
	2.	System still captures arrival time and can be backfilled with real data later.
	3.	Triage and documentation occur primarily in EPIC; TRIAGEDX is used mainly for arrival tracking and analytics.

5. Feature Breakdown (What to Build)

5.1 P-Portal (Patient Portal)

Core features:
	•	Entry modes:
	•	Mobile (QR)
	•	Kiosk/tablet
	•	Staff-assisted
	•	Forms:
	•	Demographics: name, DOB, sex, address, phone, email

	•	Large text mode
	•	Simple reading level
	•	Submission:
	•	Validation
	•	Clear success confirmation
	•	Optional simple queue-view handoff

Note: P-Portal never shows live vitals. Any “vitals” entered here are self-reported and used only as context for provisional scoring.

5.2 S-Dashboard (Staff Dashboard)

Core features:
	•	Patient queue view:
	•	List or tiled view
	•	Sort by:
	•	Provisional EWS risk level
	•	Arrival time
	•	Age
	•	Chief complaint
	•	Filters:
	•	“Critical / High”
	•	“Peds”
	•	“Unseen > 30 min”
	•	Specific complaint categories
	•	Patient card:
	•	Name / alias
	•	Age / sex
	•	Arrival time + dynamic wait duration
	•	Chief complaint
	•	Key symptom bullets
	•	Provisional EWS + color and rule-based flags
	•	Verification status (Not Verified / Verified)
	•	Status (Waiting, Called to triage, Roomed, LWBS, etc.)
	•	Actions:
	•	Mark “Called to triage”
	•	Mark “Vitals taken” (for verified EWS calc)
	•	Mark “Roomed”
	•	Mark “Left without being seen (LWBS)”
	•	Mark “Triage Complete”
	•	Notes field for staff comments

5.3 Registrar Quick-Verify Mode

Core features:
	•	Single-screen summary of submitted patient data:
	•	Name, DOB, address
	•	Phone/email
	•	Insurance summary
	•	Chief complaint
	•	Photo preview of ID and insurance (if provided)
	•	Editable demographic fields
	•	Fast workflow target: 10–20 seconds per patient
	•	Action: “Verify & Push to EPIC” which:
	•	Confirms core demographics
	•	Creates/updates FHIR Patient, Coverage, Encounter shell in EPIC
	•	Flags:
	•	Missing insurance
	•	Possible duplicate (name + DOB match)
	•	Status:
	•	“Not Verified” → “Verified (Synced to EPIC)”

Rule: No data is pushed into EPIC until a staff member completes Quick-Verify. Self-entered data is advisory until verified.

5.4 Triage Engine (Age-Aware, Sex-Aware)

Core design:
	•	Input:
	•	Patient context: age, age bracket, biological sex
	•	Chief complaint category (CHEST_PAIN, BREATHING, ABDOMINAL_PAIN, FEVER, NEURO, TRAUMA, PSYCH, OTHER)
	•	Complaint subtype (optional)
	•	Key symptom answers (from dynamic flow)
	•	Risk factors
	•	Output:
	•	Severity level: RED/ORANGE/YELLOW/GREEN
	•	Provisional EWS level: CRITICAL/HIGH/MODERATE/LOW
	•	Rule hits (transparent rule list + descriptions + weights)
	•	Human-readable rationale string
	•	Flags for display (e.g., suspected ACS, sepsis concern, etc.)
	•	Behavior:
	•	Rule-based, no black-box ML
	•	Age-aware, sex-aware thresholds
	•	Complaint-specific logic
	•	Implemented as evaluateTriage(triageInput) => {severity, ewsLevel, ruleHits, rationale}

5.5 EPIC/FHIR Integration Layer

Conceptual behavior:
	•	Internal intake data mapped to FHIR resources:
	•	Patient
	•	Coverage (insurance)
	•	Encounter (ER visit shell)
	•	Observation (EWS, maybe symptom summary)
	•	Condition / Observation for chief complaint
	•	Sync rules:
	•	Only verified demographics/insurance are synced.
	•	Patient mapping uses name + DOB + internal epicPatientId (when available).
	•	Intake summary is attached to Encounter as a document or Observation.
	•	Constraints:
	•	No real-time vital sign streaming
	•	No automatic override of nurse-entered data in EPIC
	•	TRIAGEDX remains an intake + pre-triage support tool, not a monitoring device
	•	Abstraction:
	•	EpicIntegrationService with methods:
	•	syncPatientProfile(patientProfile)
	•	syncVisit(visit, intake, ews, vitals?)

6–18

All stack, file structure, design system, testing, and future work sections remain as in your draft, with these clarifying principles locked in:
	•	TRIAGEDX:
	•	Shifts data entry from staff → patients.
	•	Generates a provisional risk signal at arrival.
	•	Requires staff verification before anything is pushed into EPIC.
	•	Does not replace nurse triage or official vitals documentation.
	•	Does not stream live vitals or behave as a medical device.
	•	Nurses:
	•	Still do full triage in-person.
	•	Still chart in EPIC.
	•	Use TRIAGEDX as a head start: clean intake + risk overview + pre-triage snapshot.
